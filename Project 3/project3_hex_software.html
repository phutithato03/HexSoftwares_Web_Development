                        <p>
                            I am Phuti Thato Ramalepe, from the small village of Polen in Limpopo, South Africa. Driven by a passion for technology and innovation, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of Johannesburg, graduating in 2024. During my studies, I gained a solid foundation in various programming languages and technologies, including Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, Visual Basic, ReactJS, React Native, Spring Boot, CSS, HTML, and Python. In addition to my degree, I earned a Cisco certification in Cybersecurity, further deepening my expertise in the field.

                            My professional goal is to become one of the worldâ€™s leading software engineers, using my skills to improve not only my life but also the lives of those in my community. My commitment to continuous learning and development drives me to hone my craft, aiming to contribute to technological advancement on a global scale.
                            
                            Beyond my technical abilities, I am a strong communicator and a team player, with a natural talent for team building and problem-solving. My personal values are centered on treating others with the utmost respect, fostering a positive and collaborative environment wherever I go.
                            
                            In my free time, I enjoy staying active by jogging, playing soccer, and basketball, which help me stay both physically fit and mentally sharp. With a passion for technology and a strong foundation of skills, I am on a path to achieving my dream of making a meaningful impact in the software engineering world.
                            I am an individual who values effective communication, demonstrating the ability to convey ideas clearly and listen attentively. I believe in the importance of respect, treating others with dignity and understanding. With a disciplined approach to tasks and responsibilities, I prioritize organization and efficiency in all endeavors. Punctuality is a key aspect of my character, as I strive to consistently meet deadlines and commitments, demonstrating reliability and professionalism.                        </p>
